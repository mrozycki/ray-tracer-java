Simple Ray Tracer
=================

Simple ray tracer built in Java as a part of summer reading.

So far it supports:

0. Primitives: spheres and tori, with modifiable colour.
1. Multiple lights (white)
2. Transformations: translation, scaling, rotation.

It also includes maths utilities for:

0. Solving single-value polynomial equations with real coefficients.
1. 3D vector calculations

It uses JAMA (in version 1.0.3) for performing matrix calculations. It is not included in the repository, but can be obtained [here](http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/).
